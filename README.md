# Elevators
This is a dummy React app, where a user can see a list of elevators and remotely operate them at the same time.

## Experience
This application was built as an assignment, it was a simple app and could have been made simply but for practice purposes and to demonstrate my skills, I decided to implement the following:

- Redux
- Redux-saga
- Axios
- Custom components
- Typescript etc.
